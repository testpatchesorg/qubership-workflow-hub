# Fork Sequence

If this repository requires forking for code changes, please follow the steps below:

1. **Create a new fork** of the repository.
2. **Commit your code changes** to the forked repository.
3. **Create a pull request** targeting the desired branch.

## Important Notes

- Due to GitHub token permissions, **forked repositories** should be used instead of committing directly to the main branch.
- Pull requests should use target branch, as some workflows (e.g., auto-labeler) will fail due to missing tokens in forks.

# 🔐 Organization Secrets & Variables

Organization-level secrets and variables referenced across actions and reusable workflows.

| Name | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` | Ephemeral GitHub-provided token (scoped to repository). Used for checkout, pushing commits/tags, creating releases. |
| `secrets.CLA_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Token for CLA workflow to read/write contributor license agreement storage. |
| `secrets.MAVEN_USER` | Username for authenticating to Maven Central when publishing release artifacts. |
| `secrets.MAVEN_PASSWORD` | Password / token paired with `MAVEN_USER` for Maven Central publishing. |
| `secrets.MAVEN_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` | ASCII‑armored GPG private key used to sign Maven artifacts (JAR, POM, etc.). |
| `secrets.MAVEN_GPG_PASSPHRASE` | Passphrase unlocking the GPG private key. |
| `secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN` | API token for publishing Python packages to PyPI. |
| `secrets.GH_ACCESS_TOKEN` | PAT for a technical (service) user with extended repository / package permissions beyond `GITHUB_TOKEN`. |
| `secrets.WORKFLOWS_TOKEN` | Classic PAT including `workflow` scope (needed to trigger/modify workflows or dispatch across repository). |
| `secrets.SONAR_TOKEN` | Token to authenticate with SonarQube / SonarCloud for code quality analysis. |
| `secrets.GH_RWD_PACKAGE_TOKEN` | PAT with read / write / delete permissions for GitHub Packages (publishing & cleanup). |
| `secrets.DOCKERHUB_USER` | Docker Hub account username used for authenticating when pushing images or increasing anonymous pull rate limits. |
| `secrets.DOCKERHUB_RW_TOKEN` | Access token / password for the Docker Hub user with read/write (and possibly delete) permissions; used for `docker login` prior to build & push steps. Rotate if leaked. |

## Dependabot Secrets

| Name | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS access key ID for Dependabot to access AWS services during dependency updates. |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS secret access key paired with `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` for AWS authentication in Dependabot. |
| `AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Specific AWS S3 access key ID for Dependabot S3 operations during dependency management. |
| `AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` | Secret key paired with `AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` for S3-specific operations in Dependabot. |

## Organization Variables

| Name | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `GH_BUMP_VERSION_APP_ID` | GitHub App ID used for automated version bumping processes. |
| `SONAR_HOST_URL` | URL of the SonarQube/SonarCloud server for code quality analysis. |
| `SONAR_ORGANIZATION` | Organization identifier in SonarQube/SonarCloud for project association. |
| `SONAR_PLUGIN_VERSION` | Version of the SonarQube plugin to use in analysis workflows. |

## Usage Guidelines

- Prefer `GITHUB_TOKEN` when sufficient; use PATs only if extra scopes (workflow dispatch, cross-repository access, delete package) are required.
- Do not echo secret values; avoid `set -x` around sensitive commands.
- Rotate external registry tokens, PATs, and GPG keys periodically (recommended quarterly).
- Keep CI GPG key separate from personal keys.
- Validate new or rotated credentials with a dry-run capable workflow before full release tasks.

## Rotation Checklist

1. Generate / rotate credential.
2. Update at organization (or repository) Secrets.
3. Invalidate/ revoke old credential where applicable.
4. Run a dry-run workflow (if supported) to confirm.
5. Remove any temporary debugging output.

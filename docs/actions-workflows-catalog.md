# Actions & Reusable Workflows Catalog

Central directory of available GitHub Actions and Reusable Workflows in this repository.

Purpose:

* Single place to browse everything (active + deprecated) with short descriptions.
* Shows deprecation status so you avoid adopting legacy components.
* Fast jumping-off point to each Action / Workflow detail readme.

Deprecation & evolution rules are defined in [Standards & Change Policy](standards-and-change-policy.md). Always check that document before modifying or depending on a deprecated component.

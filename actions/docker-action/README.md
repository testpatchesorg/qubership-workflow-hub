# 🚀 Docker Build and Publish Composite Action

This **Docker Build and Publish** GitHub Action automates the process of building and publishing Docker images using Docker Buildx. It supports multi-platform builds, custom tagging, and integration with GitHub Container Registry.

---

## Features

- Automatically builds and pushes Docker images to a container registry.
- Supports multi-platform builds using Docker Buildx.
- Allows custom image names and tags.
- Provides dry-run mode for testing without pushing images.
- Supports metadata extraction for automatic tagging.

## Usage Example

Below is an example of how to use this action in a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Build and Publish Docker Image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build and Publish Docker Image
        uses: netcracker/qubership-workflow-hub/actions/docker-action@main
        with:
          ref: main
          custom-image-name: my-custom-image
          platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
          tags: latest, v1.0.0
          dry-run: false
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Additional Information

### Dry-Run Mode

When `dry-run` is set to `true`, the action will simulate the build and push process without actually pushing the image to the registry. This is useful for testing and debugging.

### Multi-Platform Builds

The `platforms` input allows you to specify multiple platforms (e.g., `linux/amd64,linux/arm64`) for the Docker image. This is useful for creating images that can run on different architectures.

### Automatic Tagging

If the `tags` input is empty, the action will automatically generate tags based on the branch name, semantic versioning, or other metadata.

### Download Artifact

When the `download-artifact` input is set to `true`, the action will attempt to download an artifact that was previously uploaded in the same workflow using the standard `actions/upload-artifact@v4` action.

The artifact name must match the value provided in the `custom-image-name` input. This ensures that the correct artifact is downloaded and used during the Docker build process. If no artifact with the specified name exists, the action will fail.

### Logic for Determining the Docker Image Name

The action uses the following logic to determine the final name of the Docker image (`CONTAINER_NAME_RESULT`):

1. **Check if the `custom-image-name` input is provided**:
   - If the `custom-image-name` input is specified by the user, it is directly used as the name of the Docker image.

2. **Fallback to the component name**:
   - If `custom-image-name` is not provided, the action calculates the repository name (extracted from the `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` environment variable) and uses it as the Docker image name.
   - If `custom-image-name` is provided and a component file is defined, the names will be taken from the component configuration instead.


### Example Configuration

Below is an example of how to configure the action to use a component file for determining the image name:

```yaml
with:
  component: |
    [
      {
        "name": "custom-image-name",
        "file": "./Dockerfile",
        "context": "."
      }
    ]
```

In this configuration:
- If `custom-image-name` is left empty, the action will use the `name` field from the `component` configuration (`custom-image-name`) as the Docker image name.
- If no `component` is provided, the repository name will be used as the fallback.

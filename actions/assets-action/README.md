## Usage Example

Below is an example of how to use this action in a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Archive and Upload Assets

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  archive-and-upload:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run Archive and Upload Assets Action
        uses: netcracker/qubership-workflow-hub/actions/archive-and-upload-assets@main
        with:
          config-path: "./.github/assets-config.yml"
          ref: "v1.0.0"
          dist-path: "./dist"
          dry-run: false
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Configuration File

The configuration file specifies the folders and files to archive or copy. It must follow the JSON schema provided in the repository. The configuration file supports two main sections:
1. **`archives`**: Specifies folders to archive.
2. **`files`**: Specifies individual files to copy.

### Example Configuration File

```yaml
archives:
  - source: "src"
    outputName: "source-code"
    archiveType: "zip"
  - source: "docs"
    outputName: "documentation"
    archiveType: "tar.gz"

files:
  - source: "README.md"
    outputName: "readme"
  - source: "LICENSE"
    outputName: "license"
```

**Note**: The file extensions will be preserved for all uploaded files. For example, if the source file is `README.md`, the uploaded file will also have the `.md` extension.

---

## JSON Schema for Configuration File

The configuration file must adhere to the following JSON schema:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Archive Configuration Schema",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "archives": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "source": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "outputName": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "archiveType": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": ["zip", "tar", "tar.gz"]
          }
        },
        "required": ["source", "outputName", "archiveType"],
        "additionalProperties": false
      }
    },
    "files": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "source": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "outputName": {
            "type": "string"
          }
        },
        "required": ["source", "outputName"],
        "additionalProperties": false
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["archives"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

### Note

In the current implementation, it is mandatory to declare a configuration file. The action will not work without it. Ensure that the configuration file is properly defined and adheres to the schema.

## Common workflows

There are several reusable workflows which should be added into every Netcracker repository, see the description below.

### CLA

The action for [CLA](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-workflow-hub/blob/main/CLA/cla.md) "signing" for contributors.

> More info about underlying GitHub action can be found here [contributor-assistant](https://github.com/contributor-assistant/github-action)

To add the CLA signing into your repository just create the new file `.github/workflows/cla.yaml` and paste the code below:

```yaml

    uses: Netcracker/qubership-workflow-hub/.github/workflows/cla.yaml@main
    secrets:
      personal_access_token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
